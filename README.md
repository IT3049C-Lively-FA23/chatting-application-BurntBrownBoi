## Self-Evaluation:

how many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment: 

Again, besides the late submission because of my poo-poo windows 11 installation issues, a solid 18.5462x10^-23 out of 20

## Self-Reflection:
<!-- Write your self-reflection under this line -->
Im not gonna lie, I feel like JQuery requires less lines but fetch api seems more reliable. I would know, I was asked to use that when making my first swagger app at work as my intern project. so this assignment helped me snap back to reality.

### How long it took me to finish this?

45 mins. literally.

## Discussion Questions:
1. What does the bootstrap `display-4` class do?
Looks like it's used for larger headings but still not large compared to 'display-1'
